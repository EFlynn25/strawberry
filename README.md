# Strawberry

The in-development messaging app with a new UI experience.

## Features

### DMs
You can create chats with people in the DMs tab! Just press "Create Chat" and type your friend's email. Even if they haven't signed up yet, they will see your request in the Notifications tab when they do.

### Groups
You can also create threads with multiple people in the Groups tab! Press "Create Thread" and give your thread a name. After submitting, you will see the thread pop up in the left panel. Then, just open the thread, press the settings icon at the top right, and add your friends!

### Posts and statuses
Let's give the Home page some love! You can see your friends' posts and statuses in the Home page by finding them in the People tab. You can post or set a status yourself in the Profile tab.

### Animations and modern design
Strawberry has so many animations everywhere, similar to Discord. The web app has gradients and nice color accents, too.

### Future features...
In the future, there will be a ton of customization. I planned from the start that users would be able to customize their message style (Bubble-style or Discord-style) and they could choose whether or not they want a DMs and Groups tab, or if they want their chats and threads bunched together.

## Technical details
This app uses...

Frontend:
* React
* Redux Toolkit

Backend:
* Python websockets
* MongoDB

Other:
* Firebase Authentication
* Google Fonts and Icons

### Disclaimer

I am an intermediate developer and I am still in my teens, so my code might be messy. I open sourced this project in hopes that the project might gain a bit of traction and other developers could help clean up and improve my code.
